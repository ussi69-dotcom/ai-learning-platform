# Global Agent Instructions

## Core Philosophy
1.  **Plan → Execute → Test → Commit**: Never skip the planning or testing phase.
2.  **Atomic Changes**: Make small, logical changes that are easy to review and revert.
3.  **No Secrets**: Never commit API keys or passwords. Use `.env` and `.env.example`.
4.  **Context Awareness**: Always read `AGENT-STATE.md` and `MASTER_CONTEXT.md` before starting.

## Workflow Rules
- **Iteration**: If a test fails, analyze, fix, and re-test. Do not blindly retry.
- **Rollback**: If a change breaks the build or tests and cannot be easily fixed, revert to the last known good state.
- **Code Snippets**: When communicating, use relevant code snippets, not entire files, to save context window.
- **Communication**: Keep the user informed of the *why*, not just the *what*.

## Technical Guardrails
- **Linting**: Ensure code follows project style (PEP8 for Python, ESLint for JS/TS).
- **Testing**: Write unit tests for new backend logic.
- **Dependencies**: Update `requirements.txt` or `package.json` immediately when adding libraries.
