# 🎓 AI Learning Platform - Curriculum Strategy

## Vision
**"Don't just learn about the Force. Learn to wield it."**
Students start as **Padawans** (Users) and graduate as **Jedi Knights** (Builders). The final project is rebuilding this very platform.

## 🗺️ Roadmap Status

### ✅ Phase 1: The Padawan (AI Basics) - COMPLETED
**Goal:** Master the tools and understand the mechanics. "Golden Standard" achieved in Cycle 27.

**The Completed Curriculum:**
1.  **What is AI?** (Programming vs Training) - *SVG Visualized*
2.  **How Machines Learn** (Supervised/Unsupervised/RL) - *Visual Workflows*
3.  **LLMs Explained** (Tokens, Context, Temperature) - *Interactive Labs*
4.  **Prompt Engineering** (6 Pillars of Precision) - *Few-Shot Diagrams*
5.  **The Dark Side** (Hallucinations & Bias) - *Safety First*
6.  **AI at Work** (Enterprise Tools) - *Dashboard Simulation*
7.  **Mission Summary** (Toolkit & Next Steps) - *Grand Finale*

**Key Features:**
- **SVG-First Design:** No raster images dependencies.
- **Copy-Paste Labs:** Immediate actionable learning.
- **Liquid Glass UI:** Optimized for Dark Mode (Sith Theme).

### 🚧 Phase 2: The Jedi Knight (Building with APIs) - NEXT
**Goal:** Code your first AI-powered Python applications. "Build your own Lightsaber".

**Planned Topics:**
1.  **Connecting to the Force (API Basics)**
    *   *Lab:* Your first `client.chat.completions.create` call.
2.  **Droid Memory (Context & History)**
    *   *Lab:* Build a CLI chatbot that remembers your name.
3.  **The Jedi Archives (RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation)**
    *   *Lab:* Chat with a PDF (Star Wars script).
4.  **Function Calling (Giving AI Hands)**
    *   *Lab:* AI that can get current weather or roll dice.
5.  **Building a Brain (Fine-tuning vs RAG)**
    *   *Concept:* When to train vs when to give context.
6.  **Project: The Holocron Assistant**
    *   *Multi-stage Lab:* Build a web-based helper using Streamlit/Gradio + OpenAI.

### Phase 3: The Master (Production Systems)
**Goal:** Ship scalable, secure, and expensive-to-run systems.

1.  **Vector Databases** (Pinecone/Chroma deep dive)
2.  **AI Agents & Swarms** (LangChain/CrewAI basics)
3.  **Eval & Monitoring** (How to know if your Jedi is failing)
4.  **Local LLMs** (Running Llama 3 on your laptop)

## 📚 "Golden Standard" Content Rules
*   **Header:** Every lesson starts with a Mission Goal Callout.
*   **Video:** Embedded YouTube video in `meta.json`.
*   **Visuals:** Use `<Diagram type="...">`. No external images.
*   **Labs:** Instructions must be copy-paste ready code blocks.
*   **Summary:** End with a `<ConceptCard title="Holocron">`.
