# 🎓 AI Learning Platform - Curriculum Strategy

## Vision
Students don't just **learn about AI**—they **become AI builders**. The final lesson is building the very platform they're using.

## 🎯 Learning Curve Design

### Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-7) - Beginner

2. How does AI learn? (Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement)
3. Your first prompt (Talking to AI effectively)
4. AI in daily life (Recognition, recommendations, generation)
5. Ethics & limitations (Bias, hallucinations, privacy)
6. Intro to LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini comparison)
7. Week 1 Review + Mini Challenge

**Labs:** Interactive prompts, observation exercises, pattern recognition

**Success Criteria:**
- Can explain AI vs traditional programming
- Understands how training data affects AI behavior
- Can write effective prompts
- Recognizes AI in daily life

### Phase 2: Builder Basics (Days 8-14) - Intermediate
**Goal:** Build your first AI-powered tools

**Topics:**
1. OpenAI API basics (Your first API call)
2. Prompt engineering patterns (Role, context, examples)
3. Building a chatbot (Frontend + backend integration)
4. Image generation with Stable Diffusion
5. Voice synthesis with ElevenLabs
6. Combining modalities (Text → Image → Voice)
7. Week 2 Review + Deploy your first AI app

**Labs:** 
- Evening projects (45-60 min each)
- Deploy working demos to Vercel/Railway
- GitHub commits required
- Portfolio-ready projects

**Success Criteria:**
- Can make API calls to OpenAI
- Built and deployed a working chatbot
- Integrated multiple AI modalities
- Has 3+ projects in portfolio

---

### Phase 3: Production Systems (Days 15-21) - Advanced
**Goal:** Ship production-ready AI applications

**Topics (Based on research from favorite authors):**
1. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) - Build knowledge base chatbot
2. Vector databases - Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma
3. Fine-tuning LLMs - Customize models for your domain
4. AI Agents - Multi-step reasoning & tool use
5. ML Ops basics - Monitoring, logging, version control
6. Prompt injection defense - Security best practices
7. Week 3 Review + Production deployment

**Labs:**
- Multi-day projects (2-3 days each)
- Real datasets (customer support, documentation, etc.)
- Production deployment (Railway, AWS, GCP)
- Error handling and monitoring

**Success Criteria:**
- Built a production RAG system
- Understands vector embeddings
- Can fine-tune a model
- Implemented security best practices

---

### Phase 4: Meta-Project (Days 22-30) - Expert
**Goal:** Build THIS platform (inception!)

**The Final Challenge:**
Students rebuild the AI Learning Platform from scratch, using everything they learned:
- Next.js frontend (App Router, TypeScript)
- FastAPI backend (Python, Pydantic)
- PostgreSQL database (Lesson storage, user progress)
- OpenAI integration (AI feedback on exercises)
- n8n automation (Email notifications, webhooks)
- Docker deployment (Production-ready containers)

**Project Milestones:**
- Day 22-23: Setup & database design
- Day 24-25: Backend API (lessons, users, progress)
- Day 26-27: Frontend (lesson viewer, navigation)
- Day 28: AI integration (feedback system)
- Day 29: Deployment & testing
- Day 30: Open source contribution & presentation

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Ultimate test of all skills learned
- ✅ Immediate portfolio centerpiece
- ✅ "I built the thing that taught me" - powerful story
- ✅ Contribution to real open source project
- ✅ Confidence to build anything

## 📚 Topic Selection Criteria

### Sources (Already researched):
- `.ai-context/` materials
- Favorite authors (identified in early research)
- Industry best practices (Anthropic, OpenAI docs)
- Real-world case studies (production AI apps)

### Selection Rules:
1. **Relevance:** Is this used in production today?
2. **Difficulty curve:** Does it build on previous lessons?
3. **Hands-on potential:** Can students build something tangible?
4. **Career impact:** Will this help them get hired?
5. **Portfolio value:** Is this demo-worthy for interviews?

### Flexibility:
- Topics can be **reordered** for optimal learning curve
- New topics added based on **industry trends** (e.g., new model releases)
- Student feedback informs **continuous iteration**
- Advanced students can skip beginner content

## 🧪 Lab Philosophy

### Beginner Labs: Observation & Interaction
**Goal:** Build intuition without code

Examples:
- "Ask ChatGPT about yesterday's news" (knowledge cutoff)
- "Make AI hallucinate" (Reginald P. Crustworth)
- "Compare GPT-4 vs Claude responses"

**Characteristics:**
- No coding required
- Immediate feedback
- Pattern recognition
- "Aha!" moments

---

### Intermediate Labs: Guided Building
**Goal:** Learn by doing with support

Examples:
- "Build a chatbot with OpenAI API" (step-by-step)
- "Add image generation to your app" (copy-paste code)
- "Deploy to Vercel" (guided tutorial)

**Characteristics:**
- Step-by-step instructions
- Copy-paste friendly code
- "Change X and observe Y" experiments
- Working demo as output

---

### Advanced Labs: Independent Projects
**Goal:** Real developer experience

Examples:
- "Build a RAG system for your company docs" (requirements only)
- "Implement prompt injection defense" (research required)
- "Fine-tune a model on your dataset" (debugging expected)

**Characteristics:**
- Requirements-only (no step-by-step)
- Multiple solution paths
- Debugging is part of the learning
- Production-quality expected

---

### Expert Labs: Open-Ended Challenges
**Goal:** Ship real products

Examples:
- "Build this platform with these constraints"
- "Contribute a new feature to our open source repo"
- "Optimize inference latency under 100ms"

**Characteristics:**
- Open-ended problem
- No provided code
- Research and experimentation required
- Code review by maintainers
- Production deployment required

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

Students successfully complete the program when they:
1. ✅ **Understand** AI fundamentals (theory)
2. ✅ **Build** 5+ working AI tools (practice)
3. ✅ **Deploy** a production app (shipping)
4. ✅ **Contribute** to this platform (meta-learning)
5. ✅ **Portfolio** ready for job interviews



---

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement

This curriculum is **living**. We iterate based on:
- Student feedback and completion rates
- Industry trends (new models, frameworks)
- Job market demands (what employers want)
- Technology evolution (new tools, best practices)

**This document is the North Star. We may take detours, but this is our destination.**
