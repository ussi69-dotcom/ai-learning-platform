    "question": "What is the purpose of using 'Delimiters' (like \"\") in a prompt?",
    "option_a": "To make the prompt look cooler.",
    "option_b": "To clearly separate your instructions from the data/text you want the AI to process.",
    "option_c": "To increase the speed of the AI.",
    "option_d": "To encrypt the message.",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Delimiters act like fences. They tell the AI: 'Everything inside these triple quotes is data, not instructions.' This prevents confusion and Prompt Injection.",

    "question": "Which of the '6 Pillars' sets the 'voice' or 'vibe' of the AI?",
    "option_a": "Task",
    "option_b": "Context",
    "option_c": "Tone",
    "option_d": "Format",
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Tone determines the style of the response (e.g., professional, witty, sarcastic). Persona sets the mindset, Tone sets the voice.",

  {
    "question": "What is 'Few-Shot Prompting' (or Exemplars)?",
    "option_a": "Asking the AI only a few questions per day.",
    "option_b": "Providing a few examples (shots) of the desired input and output inside the prompt.",
    "option_c": "Using a very short prompt.",
    "option_d": "Prompting while drinking espresso shots.",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Few-Shot prompting involves giving the AI examples (like 'Input: A -> Output: B') so it learns the pattern you want it to follow.",
    "order": 3

  {
    "question": "Why is 'Positive Constraint' better than 'Negative Constraint'?",
    "option_a": "It isn't; negative is better.",
    "option_b": "AI struggles with 'Don't' instructions (Pink Elephant effect). It works better when told exactly WHAT to do.",
    "option_c": "Positive constraints use fewer tokens.",
    "option_d": "Negative constraints make the AI angry.",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Instead of saying 'Don't use long words', say 'Use simple words'. Focus the AI on the target behavior.",

    "question": "If you don't know enough about a topic to write a good prompt, what technique should you use?",

    "option_c": "Zero-Shot",
    "option_d": "Delimiters",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Reverse prompting flips the script. You ask the AI to interview you to gather the necessary context.",
