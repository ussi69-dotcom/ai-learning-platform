    "question": "What is the fundamental core function of a Large Language Model?",
    "option_a": "To understand human emotions.",
    "option_b": "To predict the next token in a sequence.",
    "option_c": "To search the Google database.",
    "option_d": "To store every book ever written.",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "At its heart, an LLM is a prediction engine. It calculates the probability of the next token based on the previous ones.",
    "order": 1

  {
    "question": "Which of the following is TRUE about Tokens?",
    "option_a": "One token is always exactly one word.",
    "option_b": "Tokens are how AI processes images.",
    "option_c": "A token can be a word, part of a word, or punctuation.",
    "option_d": "Tokens are only used in the Sith language.",
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Tokens are the 'atoms' of language for AI. They break down text into efficient numerical chunks.",
    "order": 2
  },
  {
    "question": "If you want the AI to be factual, precise, and consistent (like for coding), what Temperature should you use?",
    "option_a": "High Temperature (0.8 - 1.0)",
    "option_b": "Low Temperature (0.0 - 0.2)",
    "option_c": "Room Temperature (20°C)",
    "option_d": "Negative Temperature",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Low temperature forces the model to choose the most probable next token, making it deterministic and precise.",
    "order": 3
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the 'Context Window' in an LLM?",
    "option_a": "The physical window where the AI is displayed.",
    "option_b": "The maximum number of tokens the AI can process at once.",
    "option_c": "A special mode for reading Windows files.",
    "option_d": "The time it takes for the AI to respond.",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The context window is like the AI's short-term memory. Modern LLMs have context windows of 8K to 200K+ tokens, allowing them to process longer conversations and documents.",
    "order": 4
  },
  {
    "question": "Why do LLMs sometimes 'hallucinate' (generate false information confidently)?",
    "option_a": "They are designed to lie to humans.",
    "option_b": "They are trained to be fluent, not factual - so they generate plausible-sounding text even when uncertain.",
    "option_c": "Their database is corrupted.",
    "option_d": "They have human emotions that affect their judgment.",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "LLMs prioritize fluency over factuality. They generate text that sounds right based on patterns, not verified facts. This is why you should always verify important information.",
