    "option_d": "To store every book ever written.",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "At its heart, an LLM is a prediction engine. It calculates the probability of the next token based on the previous ones.",

    "option_a": "One token is always exactly one word.",

    "question": "If you want the AI to be factual, precise, and consistent (like for coding), what Temperature should you use?",
    "option_a": "High Temperature (0.8 - 1.0)",
    "option_b": "Low Temperature (0.0 - 0.2)",
    "option_c": "Room Temperature (20°C)",
    "option_d": "Negative Temperature",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Low temperature forces the model to choose the most probable next token, making it deterministic and precise.",
