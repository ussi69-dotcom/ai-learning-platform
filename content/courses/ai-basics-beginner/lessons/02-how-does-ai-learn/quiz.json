      "Teaching humans about machines",
      "Teaching computers by showing them examples",
      "A type of robot",
      "A programming language"
    ],
    "correct_answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Machine Learning is teaching computers by showing them many examples, so they can learn patterns and make predictions on new data."

    "question": "Which type of learning uses examples WITH correct answers (labels)?",
    "options": [
      "Unsupervised Learning",
      "Reinforcement Learning",
      "Supervised Learning",
      "Deep Learning"
    ],
    "correct_answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Supervised Learning is like having a teacher - you show the AI examples WITH answers (e.g., 'This is a cat', 'This is spam') so it learns to label new examples."

      "Supervised Learning",
      "Unsupervised Learning",
      "Reinforcement Learning",
      "None - it's random"

    "correct_answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Netflix uses Unsupervised Learning to find patterns in viewing habits without explicit labels, grouping similar users and recommending what they might like."

    "options": [
      "More data is always better regardless of quality",

      "Data quality doesn't matter",
      "Only the amount of data matters"
    ],
    "correct_answer": 1,
    "explanation": "'Garbage in, garbage out' - if you train AI on bad, biased, or incorrect data, it will make bad predictions. Quality matters more than quantity!"

    "correct_answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Training AI takes a long time and lots of computing power (sometimes months!), but once trained, using it is very fast (milliseconds)."
