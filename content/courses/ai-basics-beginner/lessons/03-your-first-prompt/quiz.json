    "options": [
      "A type of AI model",
      "Your question or instruction to AI",
      "An error message",
      "A programming language"
    ],
    "correct_answer": 1,
    "explanation": "A prompt is how you communicate with AI - it's your question, instruction, or request that tells the AI what you want it to do."

    "question": "According to the lesson, what makes a good prompt?",
    "options": [
      "Being as vague as possible",
      "Using technical jargon",
      "Being specific, giving context, and specifying format",
      "Making it as short as possible"
    ],
    "correct_answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Good prompts are specific (what you want), give context (who you are, what situation), and specify format (bullet points, table, etc.)."

    "question": "What is the 'Secret Formula' for effective prompts?",
    "options": [
      "Question + Answer + Format",
      "Role + Task + Context + Format",
      "Input + Output + Examples",
      "Subject + Verb + Object"
    ],
    "correct_answer": 1,
    "explanation": "The formula is: [Role] + [Task] + [Context] + [Format]. For example: 'You are a teacher (role). Explain quantum physics (task) to a 10-year-old (context) using a simple analogy (format).'"

    "question": "If AI's first answer isn't perfect, what should you do?",
    "options": [
      "Give up and start over",

      "Accept it as-is"
    ],
    "correct_answer": 2,
    "explanation": "You can iterate! Ask AI to 'make it simpler', 'add more examples', 'make it longer', etc. Prompting is a conversation, not one-and-done."

    "correct_answer": 2,
    "explanation": "AI is incredibly versatile! It can help with writing, editing, brainstorming ideas, explaining concepts, translating, summarizing text, coding, and much more."
