    "option_d": "They don't have enough technical knowledge",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Most people fail because they have wrong expectations. They treat AI like a search engine (ask → answer → close) instead of engaging in a real conversation with context and follow-ups.",

    "question": "What is the 'thinking partner mindset' about?",
    "option_a": "Letting AI make all decisions for you",

    "option_c": "Using AI only for technical tasks",
    "option_d": "Copying everything AI generates without changes",
