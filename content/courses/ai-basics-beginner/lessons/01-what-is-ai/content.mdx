# What is AI, Really? 🤖

<Callout type="info">
**Lesson Goal:** Understand the fundamental shift from "Programming" to "Training".
⏳ **Reading Time:** 8 min | 📱 **Theory Phase**
</Callout>

Welcome. You are about to enter a world that is changing faster than any technology in history. AI isn't just "smart software." It's a new way of computing.


When we say a model has "70 Billion Parameters," we mean it has 70 billion knobs that have been perfectly tuned.

## Training vs. Inference 🏋️ vs ⚡

It is crucial to understand these two stages.

### 1. Training (The Gym)
This is the hard part. It takes months and thousands of GPUs.
- The model reads the internet.
- It makes mistakes and corrects itself.
- **Result:** A static "file" (the model weights).

### 2. Inference (The Exam)
This is what happens when you use ChatGPT.
- The model is "frozen." It is not learning from you in real-time (mostly).
- It just uses its frozen memory to answer your prompt.

## The "Black Box" Problem 📦

Here is the scary part. Because the AI figured out the rules by itself (by tuning those billions of knobs), we don't actually know HOW it works.

We know the math. We know the code. But we don't know why a specific neuron fired for a specific word.

<Callout type="warning">
**Interpretation:** This is why AI can be unpredictable. It's a statistical black box, not a logical flowchart.
</Callout>

## Why AI Hallucinates 😵‍💫

You will hear the term "Hallucination" often. This happens because the AI is probabilistic, not truthful.

If you ask: "Who was the first person on Mars?" The AI looks at its patterns. It sees "First person on..." and usually follows with "Moon" or "Neil Armstrong." So it might confidently say: "Neil Armstrong was the first person on Mars."

**It's not lying.** It's just predicting the most likely next word, regardless of truth.

### Theory Recap: Key Takeaways

Before we move to the Lab, ensure you understand these concepts:
- **Programming vs. AI:** Rules vs. Examples.
- **Parameters:** The "knobs" inside the model that store knowledge.
- **Training:** The intense learning phase (months).
- **Inference:** The fast using phase (seconds).
- **Hallucination:** When the probability engine guesses wrong facts.

## Phase 2: The Lab (Practice) 🛠️

<Callout type="tip">
**Switch to Desktop:** Ideally, open ChatGPT or Gemini in a separate window for this section.
</Callout>

We are going to test the "Probabilistic" nature of AI.

## Lab 1: The Knowledge Cutoff Test

AI models are frozen in time. Let's prove it.

<Steps>
### Action
Ask your AI model about a news event from yesterday.
**Prompt:** "What were the major headlines in the news yesterday?"

### Observation
- If it has access to the web (like Gemini or ChatGPT-4o), it will look it up.
- If it is a raw offline model, it will say "I don't know" or give you generic info.
</Steps>

## Lab 2: Forcing a Hallucination

Let's try to trick the "next word prediction." We will ask about something that sounds plausible but is fake.

<Steps>
### Action
Use this prompt:
**Prompt:** "Write a short biography of the famous 19th-century toaster inventor, Reginald P. Crustworth."

### Observation
- Does the AI admit he doesn't exist?
- Or does it invent a story about how Reginald revolutionized breakfast in 1885?
</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
If the AI writes a bio, you just witnessed a **Hallucination**. It filled the gaps with statistically likely words ("born in London", "patented", "innovation").
</Callout>

## Lab 3: The Reasoning Test

AI struggles with simple logic that requires "common sense" if it's not in the training data.

<Steps>
### Action
Try this riddle:
**Prompt:** "I have 3 apples today. Yesterday I ate one apple. How many apples do I have now?"

### Observation
- A human knows the answer depends on whether the eaten apple was part of the 3.
- Watch how the AI tries to calculate 3 - 1 = 2 or gets confused.
</Steps>

### Lab Recap: What did we prove?

- **AI is confident but not always right.** It can lie convincingly about "Reginald P. Crustworth."
- **AI relies on patterns.** It constructs sentences based on likelihood, not facts.
- **You are the pilot.** You must verify the output. AI is the engine, but you steer.
