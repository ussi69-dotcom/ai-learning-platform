    "question": "What is the fundamental difference between traditional programming and Machine Learning?",
    "options": [
      "Programming uses Python, ML uses R",
      "Programming defines explicit rules, ML learns patterns from data",
      "Programming is faster, ML is slower",
      "Programming uses less memory than ML"
    ],
    "correct_answer": 1,
    "explanation": "The key shift is that traditional programming requires you to write explicit rules (if/else), while Machine Learning learns patterns from examples (data) without being explicitly programmed."

    "question": "What are 'Parameters' in a neural network?",
    "options": [
      "The number of layers in the network",
      "The training dataset size",
      "The 'knobs' or weights that store learned knowledge",
      "The programming language used"
    ],
    "correct_answer": 2,
    "explanation": "Parameters are like 'knobs' in a switchboard - they are the weights that get tuned during training to store the model's knowledge. A model with '70 Billion Parameters' has 70 billion of these tuned knobs."

  {
    "question": "What is the difference between Training and Inference?",
    "options": [
      "Training is fast, Inference is slow",
      "Training is the learning phase (months), Inference is the using phase (seconds)",
      "Training uses CPU, Inference uses GPU",
      "There is no difference"
    ],
    "correct_answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Training is the intensive learning phase that takes months and thousands of GPUs. Inference is when you use the frozen model to get answers - it's fast (seconds) because the model is already trained."

    "question": "Why is AI called a 'Black Box'?",
    "options": [
      "Because it runs in dark data centers",
      "Because we don't know HOW it arrives at specific decisions, even though we know the math",
      "Because it's encrypted",
      "Because it's proprietary software"
    ],
    "correct_answer": 1,
    "explanation": "We know the mathematics and code behind neural networks, but we don't understand WHY specific neurons fire for specific inputs. The decision-making process is opaque - hence 'black box'."

      "When AI generates images",
      "When AI makes up plausible-sounding but false information",
      "When AI crashes",
      "When AI runs slowly"
    ],
    "correct_answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Hallucination occurs when AI confidently generates false information because it's predicting the most statistically likely words, not checking facts. Example: inventing a biography for 'Reginald P. Crustworth' who doesn't exist."
