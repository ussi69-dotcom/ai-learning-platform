  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "cot-q1",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "question": "What is Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting?",
      "options": [
        "A technique that makes AI respond faster",
        "A technique that makes AI show its reasoning step-by-step",
        "A way to reduce the cost of API calls",
        "A method to train AI models"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "CoT prompting encourages AI to articulate its reasoning process step-by-step before providing a final answer, improving accuracy and interpretability."
    },
    {
      "id": "cot-q2",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "question": "What makes Zero-shot CoT special?",
      "options": [
        "It requires many examples to work",
        "It only works with GPT-4",
        "It works by just adding 'Let's think step by step' - no examples needed",
        "It's faster than other methods"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Zero-shot CoT requires no examples in the prompt. Simply adding phrases like 'Let's think step by step' triggers the AI to show its reasoning."
    },
    {
      "id": "cot-q3",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "question": "When should you use Few-shot CoT instead of Zero-shot CoT?",
      "options": [
        "When you want faster responses",
        "When the task requires a specific reasoning pattern the AI might not infer",
        "When working with simple math problems",
        "When you don't have time to write examples"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Few-shot CoT is useful when the task requires domain-specific reasoning or a particular pattern that the AI needs to learn from examples."
    },
    {
      "id": "cot-q4",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "question": "Which is NOT a benefit of Chain-of-Thought prompting?",
      "options": [
        "Reduces hallucinations",
        "Improves interpretability",
        "Makes responses faster",
        "Handles complex multi-step problems better"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "CoT actually makes responses SLOWER because the AI generates more tokens (the reasoning steps). The tradeoff is better accuracy and interpretability."
    },
    {
      "id": "cot-q5",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "question": "What is the key limitation of CoT prompting?",
      "options": [
        "It only works in English",
        "It's a prompting TRICK, not native reasoning ability",
        "It can't handle math problems",
        "It requires expensive API plans"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "CoT is a prompting technique that simulates reasoning, but it's not native to the model architecture. True reasoning models (like o1, o3) have Extended Thinking built-in."
    }
