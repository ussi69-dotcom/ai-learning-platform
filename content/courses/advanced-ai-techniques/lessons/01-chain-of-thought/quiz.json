    "question": "What does Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting primarily do?",
    "option_a": "Makes AI responses shorter",
    "option_b": "Forces AI to show its reasoning step-by-step",
    "option_c": "Connects multiple AI models",
    "option_d": "Reduces API costs",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Chain-of-Thought prompting forces the model to externalize its thinking process, showing each step of reasoning before arriving at a final answer.",

    "question": "What is the magic phrase for Zero-Shot CoT?",
    "option_a": "Please be careful",
    "option_b": "Let's think step by step",
    "option_c": "Show your work",
    "option_d": "Take your time",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The phrase 'Let's think step by step' (or variations like 'Think through this carefully') triggers chain-of-thought reasoning without needing examples.",
    "order": 2
  },
  {
    "question": "When is CoT LEAST helpful?",
    "option_a": "Complex math problems",
    "option_b": "Multi-step logical puzzles",
    "option_c": "Simple factual questions",
    "option_d": "Code debugging",
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "CoT adds overhead. For simple questions like 'What is the capital of France?', step-by-step reasoning is unnecessary and wastes tokens.",
    "order": 3
  },
  {
    "question": "What is Few-Shot CoT?",
    "option_a": "Using fewer tokens",
    "option_b": "Providing examples that include reasoning steps",
    "option_c": "Running multiple API calls",
    "option_d": "A type of fine-tuning",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Few-Shot CoT combines few-shot learning with chain-of-thought by showing examples that demonstrate both the input-output AND the reasoning process.",
    "order": 4
  },
  {
    "question": "What is a key limitation of CoT prompting?",
    "option_a": "It doesn't work with any model",
    "option_b": "It uses more tokens and may be slower",
    "option_c": "It only works in English",
    "option_d": "It requires special API access",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "CoT increases response length (more tokens = more cost) and processing time. It's a trade-off between quality and efficiency - use it strategically.",
