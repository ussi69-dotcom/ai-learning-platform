    {
      "id": "fs-q1",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "question": "What is the main difference between zero-shot and few-shot learning?",
      "options": [
        "Zero-shot is faster",
        "Few-shot provides examples in the prompt, zero-shot doesn't",
        "Zero-shot requires training, few-shot doesn't",
        "Few-shot only works with GPT-4"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The key difference is that few-shot learning includes input-output examples in the prompt, while zero-shot relies entirely on the model's pre-existing knowledge."
    },
    {
      "id": "fs-q2",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "question": "What is the recommended number of examples for few-shot prompting?",
      "options": [
        "1-2 examples",
        "3-5 examples",
        "10-15 examples",
        "As many as possible"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "3-5 examples is typically optimal - enough to establish a pattern without wasting tokens or overwhelming the model with too much information."
    },
    {
      "id": "fs-q3",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "question": "Which of these is a best practice for few-shot prompts?",
      "options": [
        "Use only similar examples to reinforce the pattern",
        "Include diverse, representative examples covering different cases",
        "Use as many examples as fit in the context window",
        "Always include at least 10 examples"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Diverse examples help the model generalize better. If all examples are similar, the model might overfit to that specific pattern."
    },
    {
      "id": "fs-q4",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "question": "What is few-shot learning BEST suited for?",
      "options": [
        "Real-time data retrieval",
        "Complex mathematical proofs",
        "Format conversion, classification, and style transfer",
        "Training new AI models"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Few-shot excels at teaching specific output formats, classification schemes, and style patterns through examples."
    },
    {
      "id": "fs-q5",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "question": "How can Few-Shot and Chain-of-Thought be combined?",
      "options": [
        "They cannot be combined",
        "By showing examples that include reasoning steps",
        "By using one before the other in separate prompts",
        "Only in Python code"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "You can combine them by providing examples that show both the input, the reasoning process, AND the output - teaching the model both WHAT to produce and HOW to think."
    }
