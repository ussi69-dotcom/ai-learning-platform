    "question": "What is the main difference between zero-shot and few-shot learning?",
    "option_a": "Zero-shot is faster",
    "option_b": "Few-shot provides examples in the prompt, zero-shot doesn't",
    "option_c": "Zero-shot requires training, few-shot doesn't",
    "option_d": "Few-shot only works with GPT-4",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The key difference is that few-shot learning includes input-output examples in the prompt, while zero-shot relies entirely on the model's pre-existing knowledge.",
    "order": 1
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the recommended number of examples for few-shot prompting?",
    "option_a": "1-2 examples",
    "option_b": "3-5 examples",
    "option_c": "10-15 examples",
    "option_d": "As many as possible",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "3-5 examples is typically optimal - enough to establish a pattern without wasting tokens or overwhelming the model with too much information.",
    "order": 2
  },
  {
    "question": "Which of these is a best practice for few-shot prompts?",
    "option_a": "Use only similar examples to reinforce the pattern",
    "option_b": "Include diverse, representative examples covering different cases",
    "option_c": "Use as many examples as fit in the context window",
    "option_d": "Always include at least 10 examples",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Diverse examples help the model generalize better. If all examples are similar, the model might overfit to that specific pattern.",
    "order": 3
  },
  {
    "question": "What is few-shot learning BEST suited for?",
    "option_a": "Real-time data retrieval",
    "option_b": "Complex mathematical proofs",
    "option_c": "Format conversion, classification, and style transfer",
    "option_d": "Training new AI models",
    "correct_answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Few-shot excels at teaching specific output formats, classification schemes, and style patterns through examples.",

  {
    "question": "How can Few-Shot and Chain-of-Thought be combined?",
    "option_a": "They cannot be combined",
    "option_b": "By showing examples that include reasoning steps",
    "option_c": "By using one before the other in separate prompts",
    "option_d": "Only in Python code",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "You can combine them by providing examples that show both the input, the reasoning process, AND the output - teaching the model both WHAT to produce and HOW to think.",
