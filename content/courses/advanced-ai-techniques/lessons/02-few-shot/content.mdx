**The best teacher doesn't explain - they demonstrate.**

When you learned to ride a bike, nobody gave you a physics lecture about balance and momentum. Someone showed you. They rode the bike, then you tried. That's the essence of **Few-Shot Learning** - teaching AI through examples rather than instructions.

Why does this matter? Because sometimes **showing is worth a thousand words of instructions**.

## The Power of Examples

<ConceptCard title="Few-Shot Learning Defined" icon="📚">

Few-Shot Learning is a prompting technique where you provide the AI with a small number of input-output examples before asking it to perform a similar task. The model learns the pattern from your examples and applies it to new inputs.

**Key insight:** You're not training the model - you're *showing* it what you want within the prompt itself.

</ConceptCard>

Consider this comparison:

| Approach | Prompt | Result Quality |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| **Zero-shot** | "Classify this sentiment" | Hit or miss |
| **One-shot** | 1 example + "Classify this" | Better |
| **Few-shot** | 3-5 examples + "Classify this" | Much better |

The magic number is usually **3-5 examples** - enough to establish a pattern, not so many that you waste tokens or confuse the model.

## Zero vs One vs Few

<Diagram type="few-shot-learning" />

### Zero-Shot (No Examples)

```text
Classify the sentiment: "This movie was terrible!"
```

The model relies entirely on its training. Works for common tasks, fails for nuanced or custom ones.

### One-Shot (Single Example)

```text
Classify the sentiment:
"I loved this book!" → Positive

"This movie was terrible!" →
```

One example helps, but the model might overfit to that specific pattern.

### Few-Shot (Multiple Examples)

```text
Classify the sentiment:
"I loved this book!" → Positive
"The service was awful" → Negative
"It was okay, nothing special" → Neutral

"This movie was terrible!" →
```

Multiple diverse examples establish a robust pattern.

<Callout type="tip">
**Pro tip:** Your examples should cover the **diversity** of expected inputs. If you only show positive examples, the model won't know how to handle negative ones!
</Callout>

## Anatomy of a Great Few-Shot Prompt

The structure matters as much as the content:

```text
[Optional: Task description]

[Example 1 Input] → [Example 1 Output]
[Example 2 Input] → [Example 2 Output]
[Example 3 Input] → [Example 3 Output]

[Your actual input] →
```

### Best Practices

| Do ✅ | Don't ❌ |
|-------|---------|
| Use diverse, representative examples | Use only similar examples |
| Keep consistent formatting | Mix different output formats |
| Include edge cases | Only show "easy" cases |
| Use clear delimiters (→, :, newlines) | Ambiguous separations |
| 3-5 examples typically | 10+ examples (diminishing returns) |

<Callout type="warning">
**Context Window Alert:** Few-shot prompts consume tokens! With limited context, balance thoroughness against length. Sometimes 3 great examples beat 7 mediocre ones.

## 🔬 Lab 1: Classification with Few-Shot

Let's build a custom sentiment classifier that understands YOUR categories.

**Objective:** Create a few-shot prompt for a 5-star rating system (not just positive/negative).

**The Prompt:**
Copy this into ChatGPT or Claude:

```text
Rate the sentiment on a scale of 1-5 stars:

"Best purchase I've ever made! Life-changing!" → ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
"Pretty good, minor issues but overall satisfied" → ⭐⭐⭐⭐
"It's fine. Does the job, nothing more" → ⭐⭐⭐
"Disappointed. Expected better quality" → ⭐⭐
"Complete waste of money. Broken on arrival" → ⭐

"The product works but the battery life could be better. Still, I use it daily." →
```

**Expected Output:**
```
⭐⭐⭐⭐
```
(Mixed feelings but overall positive - the examples taught this nuance!)

**Now try these variations:**
- "Amazing customer service, quick shipping!" →
- "Meh. It's okay I guess" →
- "DO NOT BUY. Scam company!" →

**💡 Aha Moment:** "Without examples, the AI might use binary positive/negative. With few-shot, it learned YOUR specific 5-star scale and the nuances between each level!"

## Common Few-Shot Applications

Few-shot shines in these scenarios:

### 1. Format Conversion

```text
Convert to JSON:
Name: John, Age: 30 → {"name": "John", "age": 30}
Name: Sarah, Age: 25 → {"name": "Sarah", "age": 25}

Name: Mike, Age: 45 →
```

### 2. Style Transfer

```text
Make it sound like a pirate:
"Hello, how are you?" → "Ahoy there! How be ye sailin' today?"
"I'm going to the store" → "I be headin' to the merchant's quarters!"

"Can you help me?" →
```

### 3. Entity Extraction

```text
Extract the company and product:
"Apple released the iPhone 15 today" → Company: Apple, Product: iPhone 15
"Microsoft announced Windows 12" → Company: Microsoft, Product: Windows 12

"Tesla unveiled the Cybertruck 2.0" →
```

### 4. Custom Classification

```text
Classify the programming question difficulty:
"How do I print hello world?" → Beginner
"Implement a binary search tree" → Intermediate
"Optimize a distributed consensus algorithm" → Advanced

"Write a recursive fibonacci function" →
```

## 🔬 Lab 2: Style Transfer Magic

Let's teach AI a completely custom writing style!

**Objective:** Make AI write like a specific character or tone using few-shot examples.

**The Prompt:**
Copy this (teaching AI to respond like a dramatic movie trailer narrator):

```text
Rewrite as a dramatic movie trailer narration:

"I went to get coffee" → "In a world where caffeine was the only hope... ONE MAN... would make the ultimate journey... TO THE COFFEE MACHINE."

"The meeting was boring" → "They thought it would be just another meeting... They were WRONG. BOREDOM... like they've never experienced... THIS SUMMER."

"I need to do laundry" → "The clothes... were dirty. The hamper... overflowing. And ONE HERO must rise... to face... THE LAUNDRY."

"I'm hungry and want pizza" →
```

**Expected Output:**
Something like:
```
"In a city consumed by hunger... ONE CRAVING would change everything... PIZZA. This fall... PREPARE... for DELIVERANCE."
```

**Try your own:**
- "My phone battery is at 5%"
- "I forgot my password again"
- "The WiFi is down"

**💡 Aha Moment:** "You just taught AI a completely custom style that doesn't exist in any manual! Few-shot learning lets you CREATE new behaviors, not just invoke existing ones."

## Few-Shot vs Chain-of-Thought

<Callout type="info">
**Connection to Previous Lesson:**
Few-shot and Chain-of-Thought can be combined! You can show examples that include reasoning steps, teaching the AI both WHAT to output and HOW to think.
</Callout>

| Technique | Best For | Examples Contain |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| **Few-shot** | Output format, classification, style | Input → Output |
| **CoT** | Complex reasoning, math, logic | Thinking steps |
| **Few-shot + CoT** | Complex tasks with specific format | Input → Reasoning → Output |

## When Few-Shot Fails

Few-shot isn't magic. It struggles when:

| Scenario | Why It Fails | Alternative |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| Task is too complex | Examples can't capture all nuances | Use CoT or fine-tuning |
| Not enough diversity | Model overfits to examples | Add more varied examples |
| Context is too long | Examples eat up token budget | Reduce examples, be concise |
| Task requires real-time data | Model can't learn from examples | Use tools/RAG |
