## What You'll Learn (Preview)

<ConceptCard title="Fine-Tuning Overview" icon="🎓">

**Fine-tuning** is the process of taking a pre-trained model and further training it on your specific data to:

- **Adapt to your domain** - Medical, legal, technical terminology
- **Match your style** - Tone, format, response patterns
- **Improve consistency** - Reliable outputs for specific tasks
- **Reduce prompt length** - Bake instructions into the model

**Coming in this lesson:** Step-by-step guide from data prep to deployment!
