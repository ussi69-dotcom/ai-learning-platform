    "question": "Why is it recommended to initially use 'create a draft email' instead of 'reply directly to sender' when building autonomous email workflows?",
    "option_a": "Drafts are faster to create",
    "option_b": "To maintain a 'human in the loop' for quality review",
    "option_c": "Direct replies don't work with Workflows Agent",
    "option_d": "Drafts save API calls",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Using drafts instead of direct replies keeps a 'human in the loop' to review accuracy and tone before sending, which is important during the early-access phase of the tool.",

    "question": "What is the main advantage of Workflows Agent over Power Automate for email handling?",
    "option_a": "It runs faster than Power Automate",
    "option_b": "It can understand context and sentiment, not just follow rigid rules",
    "option_c": "It requires no Microsoft 365 license",
    "option_d": "It works offline without cloud connection",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Workflows Agent uses LLM reasoning to understand context, sentiment, and nuance in emails, while Power Automate follows deterministic rules that can't interpret meaning.",
