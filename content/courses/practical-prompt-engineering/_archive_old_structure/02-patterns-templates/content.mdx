## The Learning Curve

Most people treat LLMs like search engines. They ask a question and hope for the best. This is **Zero-Shot** prompting. It works for general knowledge, but fails at specific tasks.

To make the AI truly smart, we must teach it *in the prompt*. We use patterns that guide its reasoning process.

## 1. Zero-Shot Prompting
This is the baseline. You give the task without examples.
> "Translate 'Hello' to French."

It relies entirely on the model's pre-trained knowledge.

## 2. Few-Shot Prompting (The Exemplars)
This is where the magic happens. By providing a few examples (shots), you drastically improve performance and adherence to format.

<Diagram type="few-shot-learning" />

**Why it works:** The examples act as a pattern for the AI to complete. It's like showing a Padawan a lightsaber move before asking them to replicate it.

### Structure
1.  Example Input
2.  Example Output
3.  Example Input
4.  Example Output
5.  **Actual Input** -> **?**

## 3. Chain of Thought (CoT)
For logic, math, or complex reasoning, the model often rushes to an answer and gets it wrong.
**The Fix:** Force it to "think out loud."

<Diagram type="chain-of-thought" />

The magic phrase: **"Let's think step by step."**
This forces the model to generate reasoning tokens *before* the final answer, which actually gives it time to "compute" the result.

## Interactive Lab 01: Teaching a New Language

<Steps>

### The Challenge
We want the AI to translate English into "Yoda-speak".
A **Zero-Shot** attempt might fail because it might just translate to standard syntax or overdo it.

### The Zero-Shot Attempt
Try this:
```text
Translate this to Yoda-speak: "I will go to the store."
```
*Result: Likely okay, but maybe inconsistent.*

### The Few-Shot Fix
Now, let's force the style using examples.

```text
Translate English to Yoda-speak.

English: "I am hungry."
Yoda: "Hungry I am."

English: "The force is strong with you."
Yoda: "Strong with you, the force is."

English: "I will go to the store."
Yoda:
```

### Observation
The model now perfectly mimics the syntactic inversion pattern from your examples.

## Interactive Lab 02: The Math Problem

<Steps>

### The Problem
LLMs are notoriously bad at word problems if they answer immediately.

### The Fail (Standard Prompt)
```text
Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now?
Answer immediately with a single number.
```
*Risk:* The model might say 7 (5+2) instead of 11 (5 + 2*3).

### The Fix (Chain of Thought)
```text
Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now?
Let's think step by step.
```

### Observation
Watch the model break it down:
1.  Starts with 5.
2.  2 cans * 3 balls/can = 6 new balls.
3.  5 + 6 = 11.
**Result:** Correct answer.

## The Holocron

<ConceptCard title="The Prompting Patterns" icon="🧠" jediQuote="Do or do not. There is no try.">

*   **Zero-Shot:** Fast, good for general knowledge. (No examples)
*   **Few-Shot:** High precision, teaches style/format. (Uses Exemplars)
*   **Chain of Thought:** Critical for math/logic. (Uses "Step by step")

**Pro Tip:** Combine them! Use Few-Shot examples that *include* Chain of Thought reasoning.
