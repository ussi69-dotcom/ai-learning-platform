    "option_c": "Asking the AI to do nothing",
    "option_d": "Providing bad examples",
    "correct_answer": "A",

  {
    "question": "What is the main advantage of 'Few-Shot' prompting?",
    "option_a": "It is faster to type",
    "option_b": "It forces the AI to follow a specific format or style by imitation",
    "option_c": "It uses fewer tokens",
    "option_d": "It makes the AI hallucinate more",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Few-Shot provides 'exemplars' that the model mimics, improving consistency and format adherence.",

    "option_c": "Let's think step by step",
    "option_d": "Ignore previous instructions",

    "question": "When should you use Chain of Thought (CoT)?",
    "option_a": "For simple greetings",
    "option_b": "For complex math, logic, or reasoning problems",
    "option_c": "For creative poetry",
    "option_d": "Always, it never hurts",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "CoT is most effective for tasks requiring multi-step reasoning where immediate intuitive answers might be wrong.",
