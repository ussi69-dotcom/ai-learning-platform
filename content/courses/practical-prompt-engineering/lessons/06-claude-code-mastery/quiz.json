    "question": "What is the key difference between agentic AI (like Claude Code) and traditional AI assistants?",
    "option_a": "Agentic AI is faster",
    "option_b": "Agentic AI can take actions, not just suggest them",
    "option_c": "Agentic AI is cheaper",
    "option_d": "Agentic AI only works in Python",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The fundamental difference is that agentic AI like Claude Code can actually execute commands, edit files, and verify changes - not just suggest what to do.",

    "question": "What are Claude Code 'hooks'?",
    "option_a": "Ways to connect to external APIs",
    "option_b": "Shell commands that execute in response to Claude Code events",
    "option_c": "Visual debugging tools",
    "option_d": "Test automation frameworks",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Hooks are automated triggers that execute shell commands when specific Claude Code events occur (like file writes or tool usage).",

    "question": "When should you use Claude Code's plan mode?",
    "option_a": "For simple one-line fixes",
    "option_b": "For complex, multi-file implementations and architectural changes",
    "option_c": "Only for testing",
    "option_d": "When you want faster responses",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Plan mode is designed for complex tasks that require thinking through the implementation before writing code - like multi-file refactors, new features, or architectural changes.",

  {
    "question": "What is the recommended debug workflow with Claude Code?",
    "option_a": "Describe the error verbally → Wait for solution",
    "option_b": "Show the error → Let Claude investigate → Fix → Verify",
    "option_c": "Fix it yourself → Ask Claude to review",
    "option_d": "Ignore errors and continue",
    "correct_answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The optimal workflow is: show the actual error (paste stack trace or run the failing command), let Claude investigate the codebase, implement a fix, then verify the fix works.",
