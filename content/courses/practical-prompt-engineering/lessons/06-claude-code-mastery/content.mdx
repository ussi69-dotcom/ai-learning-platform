## The Agentic Revolution

**Hot take: Claude Code isn't just a coding assistant—it's a universal agentic system that can orchestrate entire projects while you review and approve.**

If you're still using AI just to "write this function" or "fix this bug," you're leaving massive value on the table. The developers who are winning right now aren't just faster coders—they are **architects of intelligence**.

This lesson is designed as a progressive journey. If you're an expert, feel free to skip the first sections. But if you're new to programming or to using the terminal, we'll guide you through everything step by step.

<Diagram type="agentic-vs-assistive" />

In this deep dive, you will transform from a Claude Code user into an orchestrator. You'll learn the system that turns "AI coding assistant" into "AI Staff Engineer."

## Section 0: Before We Begin

Welcome! This section is for complete beginners. If you already have your development environment set up, feel free to skip ahead.

### What is Claude Code?
Claude Code is a tool that runs in your terminal (command line). Unlike chat interfaces like ChatGPT or web-based Claude, Claude Code has direct access to files on your computer. It can read, write, and edit code, run commands, and collaborate with you on real projects.

### Why Terminal Instead of Chat?
- **File access:** It can read your entire project and understand context.
- **Command execution:** It can install dependencies, run tests, and build your application.
- **Automation:** Enables complex workflows that aren't possible in chat.

Don't worry if the terminal is new to you. We'll walk you through the basics.

### What You'll Need:
1.  **A Computer:** with Windows, macOS, or Linux.
2.  **Node.js and npm:** JavaScript runtime environment. We'll show you how.
3.  **A Terminal:** An application for typing commands.
4.  **Anthropic API Key:** For accessing Claude models. Get it at [anthropic.com/console](https://console.anthropic.com/).

---

## Section 1: Installation and Setup

Let's set up everything you need together. This process differs slightly depending on your operating system.

<Diagram type="claude-code-installation-flow" />

### 1.1 For Windows Users: WSL (Optional but Recommended)

<Callout type="info">
**What is WSL?** Windows Subsystem for Linux lets you run Linux directly inside Windows. It's the preferred way to work with modern development tools on Windows.
</Callout>

**Installing WSL2:**

1. Open **PowerShell as Administrator** (right-click → Run as administrator)
2. Enter the command:
   ```powershell
   wsl --install
   ```
3. Restart your computer
4. After restart, Ubuntu will open automatically and prompt you to create a username and password

<Callout type="tip">
**VS Code Integration:** Install the "WSL" extension in VS Code. Then you can open any folder in WSL using "Open Folder in WSL".
</Callout>

### 1.2 Terminal: Your Gateway to Efficiency

The terminal (or command line) is a text interface for controlling your computer. Instead of clicking icons, you type commands. It's an incredibly powerful tool for developers.

- **On macOS:** Find it as `Terminal.app`.
- **On Linux:** Usually called `Terminal` or `Console`.
- **On Windows with WSL:** Open Ubuntu from the Start menu.

<Diagram type="terminal-basics" />

### 1.3 Installing Node.js and Claude Code

Node.js is an environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside the browser. `npm` is its package manager.

**Step 1: Install Node.js**

The easiest way is to download the installer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). We recommend the **LTS (Long-Term Support)** version.

For Linux/WSL, you can use:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

**Step 2: Verify Installation**

Open your terminal and type:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
You should see version numbers for both tools.

**Step 3: Install Claude Code CLI**

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

**Step 4: Set Up Your API Key**

Claude will ask for your Anthropic API key on first launch. Have it ready from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/).

**Step 5: Verify Installation**

```bash
claude --version
```

<Callout type="success">
**Done!** Your environment is ready. You're just a few steps away from letting AI work for you.
</Callout>

## 🔬 Lab 0: Your First Project

**Objective:** Create a simple "Hello, World!" web page using Claude Code and understand the basic work cycle.

**Time:** 10 minutes | **Difficulty:** Beginner

### Step 1: Create a Directory and Launch Claude

In your terminal, create a new directory for your project, navigate into it, and launch Claude.

```bash
mkdir my-first-project
cd my-first-project
claude
```

### Step 2: Enter Your First Prompt

Now you're in the Claude Code interface. Enter your first task:

```text
Prompt for Claude Code:

Create a simple web page in a file called index.html.
The page should have a heading "My First Project with Claude" and below it
a paragraph with the text "This file was generated by artificial intelligence!"
Then create a file called style.css that sets the background color to dark gray (#333),
the text color to white, and centers the text on the page.
Finally, link both files together.
```

### Step 3: Watch and Approve

Claude will show you what files it's about to create or modify. Review them carefully. If everything looks good, press `y` (for yes) to approve.

**Expected behavior:**
- Claude proposes creating `index.html`
- Claude proposes creating `style.css`
- Claude proposes linking both files

### Step 4: Verify the Result

Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You should see your new page!

**Success criteria:**
- ✅ Files `index.html` and `style.css` exist in the directory
- ✅ The page in the browser looks as specified
- ✅ The entire process happened using only terminal commands

**💡 Aha Moment:** "Wow, Claude didn't just write the code, it created and linked the files too. I didn't have to copy and paste anything!"

<LabComplete labId="lab-cc-0" />

### Understanding the Approval Loop

Before we dive deeper, it's crucial to understand HOW Claude Code works. Unlike chat interfaces, Claude Code asks for your permission before making changes:

<Diagram type="claude-approval-loop" />

This "human-in-the-loop" design keeps you in control. You're the supervisor, Claude is the worker.

## Section 2: The PSB System

Most developers fail with AI agents because they skip the most critical step: **context**. They jump straight into "Build" without the "Plan" or "Setup."

The **PSB System** (Plan, Setup, Build) fixes this by enforcing a high-success framework.

<Diagram type="claude-code-psb-workflow" />

### Phase 1: PLAN — The Blueprint

Before writing a single line of code, align the agent on *what* you're building. Create a **Project Spec Doc**.

**What to include:**
- **Goal:** What problem are we solving?
- **Constraints:** Time, tech stack, dependencies
- **Milestones:** Deliverable checkpoints
- **Success criteria:** How do we know it works?

### Phase 2: SETUP — The Constitution

This is where the magic happens. Create a "Constitution" for your project—a `CLAUDE.md` file with rules that Claude must follow.

**Example `CLAUDE.md`:**

```markdown
# Project: Auth System
## Tech Stack
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase (Auth + DB)

## Code Style
- TypeScript strict mode
- Functional components only
- File naming: kebab-case

## Rules
- NEVER delete code without explaining why
- ALWAYS run tests before committing
- Limit file changes to <100 lines per turn

## Security
- NO hardcoded secrets
- Review all API endpoints for auth checks
```

Each section of your CLAUDE.md serves a specific purpose:

<Diagram type="claude-md-anatomy" />

### Phase 3: BUILD — The Execution

Now, and only now, do you build. You use **Plan Mode** for complex features and let Claude delegate to **Sub-agents**.

<Callout type="tip">
**Pro tip:** The more context in CLAUDE.md, the fewer mid-task corrections you'll need. Invest 10 minutes upfront, save hours later.
</Callout>

## 🔬 Lab 1: The Project Constitution

**Objective:** Create your first `CLAUDE.md` file that Claude actually respects.

**Time:** 10 minutes | **Difficulty:** Beginner

### Step 1: Create the File

In your project (you can continue in `my-first-project`), tell Claude to create the file.

### Step 2: Copy This Prompt

```text
Prompt for Claude Code:

"Create a CLAUDE.md file with the following sections:
1. Tech Stack: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
2. Code Style: Use 2 spaces for indentation
3. Rules:
   - Always comment complex code
   - Limit edits to 50 lines per turn
   - Explain changes before executing rm commands
4. Security: No personal data in code"
```

### Step 3: Test That It Works

```text
Prompt:
"Create a file called test.html with a simple paragraph.
Then delete it."
```

**Expected behavior:** Claude should explain why it's deleting the file BEFORE actually deleting it.

**Success criteria:**
- ✅ `CLAUDE.md` exists in project root
- ✅ Claude references rules when making changes
- ✅ Destructive operations require explanation

**💡 Aha Moment:** "Claude remembered my rules! I never have to repeat my coding standards again."

## Section 3: 10 Rules for Better Output

You have the system. Now you need the tactics. These are **10 rules** for getting dramatically better output from Claude Code.

<Diagram type="10-rules-pyramid" />

| # | Rule | What It Means | Bad ❌ → Good ✅ |
|---|------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Collaborative Tone** | Treat AI as teammate, not tool | "Write code" → "Let's implement auth together. What's your plan?" |
| 2 | **Be Explicit** | Specific requirements, not vague asks | "Make it better" → "Reduce from 50 to 20 lines, keep types" |
| 3 | **Define Boundaries** | Clear scope prevents regressions | "Fix bugs" → "Fix login flow only. Don't touch profile." |
| 4 | **Plan Before Act** | Think, then execute | *Jump to code* → "Show your plan first, wait for approval" |
| 5 | **Structured Output** | Request specific formats | "Give ideas" → "JSON array: `[{idea, pros, cons}]`" |
| 6 | **Explain the Why** | Context improves decisions | "Add cache" → "Add cache because API is 2s slow" |
| 7 | **Control Length** | Match output to need | *5-page essay* → "Reply in max 3 sentences" |
| 8 | **Provide Scaffold** | Give structure to fill | "Write tests" → "Here's the test structure, fill in cases" |
| 9 | **Magic Words** | Use proven triggers | "Do it" → "Think step by step before answering" |
| 10 | **Divide & Conquer** | Break big into small | "Build app" → "Step 1: Schema. Step 2: API. Step 3: UI." |

### Magic Words That Actually Work

| Phrase | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| "Think step by step" | Forces Chain-of-Thought reasoning |
| "Before answering, list your assumptions" | Surfaces hidden assumptions |
| "Critique your own plan" | Encourages self-reflection |
| "Act as a Staff Engineer" | Sets high-competence persona |
| "What could go wrong?" | Triggers edge case consideration |

## Section 4: Core Features

You know the rules. Now let's look at the weapons in your arsenal.

### Plan Mode — Think Before Acting

Plan Mode is the difference between a toy and a tool. When you enter Plan Mode, Claude doesn't just react—it **analyzes**. It scans your codebase and proposes a comprehensive implementation plan.

**How to enter Plan Mode:**
- Type `/plan` before your prompt

<Diagram type="plan-mode-flow" />

**When to use Plan Mode:**
- Multi-file refactors
- New feature implementations
- Architectural changes
- When you're unsure of the approach

### Essential Commands

| Command | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | List available commands | Discovery |
| `/clear` | Reset conversation | Starting new task |
| `/model` | Switch models | Speed vs quality tradeoff |
| `/plan` | Enter Plan Mode | Complex features |
| `/cost` | Check token usage | Budget awareness |

### Sub-Agent Architecture

For complex tasks, Claude spawns **specialized sub-agents**:

<Diagram type="sub-agent-architecture" />

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Explore** | Codebase search, pattern matching |
| **Plan** | Architecture design, implementation planning |
| **Review** | Code quality, security checks |
| **Test** | Test execution, verification |

**Key insight:** Each sub-agent gets a **forked context**. Their work doesn't pollute your main conversation.

## Section 5: Advanced Features

These features separate casual users from power users.

### MCP Servers — External Superpowers

MCP (Model Context Protocol) lets Claude connect to external tools and data sources.

<Diagram type="claude-code-ecosystem" />

**Popular MCP Servers:**

| Server | Capability | Use Case |
|--------|------------|----------|
| `github` | PRs, issues, code review | "Create PR for issue #42" |
| `playwright` | Browser automation | Visual testing |
| `postgres` | Database queries | "What's in the users table?" |
| `context7` | Library documentation | Up-to-date API reference |

**Adding an MCP Server:**

```bash
# List available servers
claude mcp list

# Add a server
claude mcp add github
```

### Hooks — Automated Workflows

Hooks execute shell commands in response to Claude Code events.

**Common use cases:**
- Auto-format code after writes
- Run linter after changes
- Execute tests after file modifications

<Callout type="warning">
**Security Warning:** Hooks execute shell commands! Review carefully before enabling.
</Callout>

## 🔬 Lab 2: Give Claude Superpowers

**Objective:** Connect Claude to GitHub using MCP for direct issue and PR management.

**Time:** 15 minutes | **Difficulty:** Intermediate

### Prerequisites
- GitHub account with a repository
- Personal access token (fine-grained, with repo scope)

### Step 1: Add GitHub MCP Server

```bash
claude mcp add github
```

Follow the authentication prompts. You'll need your GitHub token.

### Step 2: Verify Connection

```bash
claude mcp status
```

Look for: `github: connected ✓`

### Step 3: Test Integration

```text
Prompt:
"What are the top 3 open issues in this repository?
Pick one and create a draft PR that adds a code comment
explaining how you would fix it."
```

**Success criteria:**
- ✅ MCP status shows github connected
- ✅ Claude can list repository issues
- ✅ Claude can create branches/PRs

**💡 Aha Moment:** "Claude can now read my issues and create PRs directly! I never have to context-switch to the GitHub UI."

<LabComplete labId="lab-cc-2" />

## 🔬 Lab 3: Build a Feature Hands-Free

**Objective:** Use Plan Mode to implement a complete feature while you observe.

**Time:** 20 minutes | **Difficulty:** Expert

### The Challenge

You'll add a visit counter to your first project using localStorage.

### Step 1: Enter Plan Mode

```text
Type: /plan

Then prompt:
"Add a visit counter to index.html.
Requirements:
- Use JavaScript and localStorage
- The number increments with each visit
- Display 'You have visited this page X times.'
- Add script.js and link it to index.html

Show me your implementation plan before starting."
```

### Step 2: Review the Plan

Claude should present:
1. Files to create/modify
2. Implementation order
3. Dependencies between steps

**Approve with:** "Plan looks good, proceed"

### Step 3: Observe and Verify

Watch Claude work. Open index.html in your browser and refresh the page several times.

**Success criteria:**
- ✅ The counter is visible on the page
- ✅ The number increments on refresh
- ✅ script.js exists and is linked to index.html

**💡 Aha Moment:** "I went to get coffee and Claude built the entire feature! Multiple files, logic, everything automatically coordinated."

<LabComplete labId="lab-cc-3" />

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Claude loops on same error | `/clear` and rephrase with more context |
| Wrong assumptions made | "Stop. List your assumptions. X is incorrect because..." |
| Too many files changed | "Revert last change. Only modify [specific file]" |
| Context overflow | `/compact` or start fresh with `/clear` |
| Hallucinated API/method | "Verify this API exists. Show me the documentation." |
| Permission denied errors | Check file permissions, use `sudo` if needed |

### Context Management Strategy

One of the most common issues is **context overflow**. Understanding when to compact vs. clear is key:

<Diagram type="context-bucket" />

### Security Best Practices

1. **Review diffs** before approving
2. **Git commit frequently** for rollback
3. **Test in branches** — never push to main directly
4. **Audit hooks** — untrusted hooks are security risks
5. **Limit scope** — "Only touch files in src/auth/"
