    "genesis_desc": "It all started on Sunday, November 15, 2025. A spark of curiosity ignited an obsession with AI agents. We began prototyping in Galaxy.AI with Claude Sonnet 4.5, but hit a wall—a naive massive context transfer led to an instant ban from Anthropic. That was the turning point. On November 18, Gemini 3.0 Pro dropped, and we immediately deployed it as our primary advisor in VS Code. Two days later, November 20, Google unveiled Antigravity—we integrated it that same evening, and development velocity hit Mach 10. On November 24, the Gemini 3.0 CLI invite arrived. The loop was closed. We call this 'Zero-Day Engineering'—a new AI model drops in the morning, and by evening, it's powering production.",
